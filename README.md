# Student-Performance-Prediction-Using-R
Education Data Analysis

###Statement of Problem
Data mining is widely used in educational field. Student performance is of great concern in the educational institution where several factors may affect student performance. For prediction the three required components are: Parameters which affect the student performance, Data mining methods and third one is data mining tool. These Parameters may be psychological, personal, and environmental. The study is conducted to maintain the education quality of this university by minimizing the diverse affect of these factors on student’s performance. In this Project, The Evaluation of student performance is done by applying data mining tool called R programming. By applying data mining techniques on student data we can
1.	Obtain knowledge which describes the student performance. 
2.	 Improve the education quality, student’s performance and to decrease failure rate. All these will help to improve the quality of institute.  


###Aims and Objectives
The aim of this project is to effectively and accurately evaluate the performance of students result in an institution using R programming language.  
1.	To study and identify the gaps in existing prediction methods.
2.	To study and identify the variables used in analyzing students performance.
3.	To study the existing prediction methods for predicting students performance.

###Methodology
This chapter explains the architecture of an integrated frame work for evaluating student performance using R programming language.
DESIGN CONSIDRATION
The following are included in the integrated frame work for evaluating student performance 
 The student first semester results to evaluate the performance of the students 
1.	Before using a data set in R studio you need to download a packages called RIO, rio is package is a relatively recent R package, developed by Thomas J. Leeper, which makes data import and export in R painless and quick.
2.	Now after the Rio package is installed you can now import data set from excel or any other sources.
3.	After importing data set from excel from then the code to execute the datas can now be written in the R studio.
Collection of student data: The result of all students first semester 2014/2015 session is input into the an excel.
Data Pre-processing: This is the first step of evaluation, the data set in the excel will be import to the R studio this is possible with the help of (rio) which makes the importation of data to be easier from other sources.
Data Mining: This aspect include the classification of data set.
Result Evaluation: This is the final result of the data set, after getting the data set we can now predict the result of a particular student in the next two or three years from the previous data set that is available.
