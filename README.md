# Student-Performance-Prediction-Using-R
Education Data Analysis

### Statement of Problem
Data mining is widely used in educational field. Student performance is of great concern in the educational institution where several factors may affect student performance. For prediction the three required components are: Parameters which affect the student performance, Data mining methods and third one is data mining tool. These Parameters may be psychological, personal, and environmental. The study is conducted to maintain the education quality of this university by minimizing the diverse affect of these factors on student’s performance. In this Project, The Evaluation of student performance is done by applying data mining tool called R programming. By applying data mining techniques on student data we can
1.	Obtain knowledge which describes the student performance. 
2.	 Improve the education quality, student’s performance and to decrease failure rate. All these will help to improve the quality of institute.  


### Aims and Objectives

The aim of this project is to effectively and accurately evaluate the performance of students result in an institution using R programming language.  
1.	To study and identify the gaps in existing prediction methods.
2.	To study and identify the variables used in analyzing students performance.
3.	To study the existing prediction methods for predicting students performance.

### Methodology

This chapter explains the architecture of an integrated frame work for evaluating student performance using R programming language.
**DESIGN CONSIDRATION**

The following are included in the integrated frame work for evaluating student performance 
 The student first semester results to evaluate the performance of the students 
1.	Before using a data set in R studio you need to download a packages called RIO, rio is package is a relatively recent R package, developed by Thomas J. Leeper, which makes data import and export in R painless and quick.
2.	Now after the Rio package is installed you can now import data set from excel or any other sources.
3.	After importing data set from excel from then the code to execute the datas can now be written in the R studio.

**Collection of student data:** The result of all students first semester 2014/2015 session is input into the an excel.

**Data Pre-processing**: This is the first step of evaluation, the data set in the excel will be import to the R studio this is possible with the help of (rio) which makes the importation of data to be easier from other sources.

**Data Mining:** This aspect include the classification of data set.

**Result Evaluation:** This is the final result of the data set, after getting the data set we can now predict the result of a particular student in the next two or three years from the previous data set that is available.

**Student Information:** This include the information of the student or the data set needed to evaluate the student performance.

**Data Integration:** is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as cleansing, ETL mapping, and transformation.

**Data Cleaning:** is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data.

**Data Transformation:** is the process of converting data from one format or structure into another format or structure. It is a fundamental aspect of most data integration and data management tasks such as data wrangling, data warehousing, data integration and application integration.

**Attribute Selection:** is the process of selecting a subset of relevant features (variables, predictors) for use in model construction.

**Data Classification:** is the process of organizing data into categories for its most effective and efficient use. A well-planned data classification system makes essential data easy to find and retrieve.

**Prediction/Evaluation:** is a systematic set of predictions run on examples that are already labelled and then compared against the labelled ground truth to come up with metrics that determine how good or bad a specific machine learning model performs.


### Design Implementation
This chapter describes the implementation, evaluation, testing and requirement for evaluating student performance using R programming language and putting into reality all the design concepts and methodology in which all the functions and objectives of the analysis were realized. It also contains screenshots of the project during implementation. The project was implemented using R studio for which is the IDE for writing the code, excel for representing student results, and some other packages available in R studio to carry out the project effectively.

The major software applications are:
1.	R studio IDE.
2.	Excel Spread sheet.
3.	Installation of R studio packages.

### Summary and Conclusion

**Summary**
Data Mining detects the relevant patterns from databases/data warehouses using different programs and algorithms to look into current and historical data which can be analyzed to predict future trends.
Statisticians have used different manual techniques for the benefit of the business, predicting trends and results based on data over the years. The business houses had developed huge databases or data warehouses to become “data tombs”. The data was never transformed into information. But with the help of data mining tools and algorithms now professionals from different areas may extract knowledge quickly and at ease.
Performance of students in certain course, grade inflation, anticipated percentage of failing students, and assist in grading system. Up to our knowledge, there are no studies that use classification to predict a student final outcome based on his/her grades in a program study plan. Analyzing all the courses that are required in the study plan will identify the list of courses that have a huge impact on final results.

**Conclusion**
In this work, integrated frame work for evaluating student performance is easily collected and managed with improved reliability, durability and efficiency. 
The most prominent feature of evaluating student performance can easily be analyse using R programing language which is mostly use by statisticians to get accurate results. Many previous works make use of a Weka and some other data mining techniques, where If we are not given those similar item set, then WEKA show an error pop-up message because WEKA does not support any undeclared numerical or string value and   WEKA cannot generate individually any student’s performance, we can find only frequently possibility of overall students’ performance. From here, teachers can judge, from next time what type of students will be going to get good remarks in his absence.


### Limitations

In R,quality of some packages is less than perfect. In R, no one to complain, if something doesn't work. R is a software Application that many people devote their own time to developing. R commands give little thought to memory management, and so R can consume all available memory.
